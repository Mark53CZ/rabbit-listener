# rabbit-listener

Listens for messages in RabbitMQ. 

* Fully compatible with [rabbit-chatter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rabbit-chatter)
* Easy to use and fast to implement
* Stable
* Very few dependencies
* Build upon [amqplib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amqplib)

# Usage

Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the module:

```
	npm install rabbit-listener
```

Then use `require()` to load it in your code:

```javascript
	var rabbitListener = require('rabbit-listener');
```

Initialize a new instance:

```javascript
	var rabbit = rabbitListener.rabbit(options);
```

And then you can start listening for messages:

```javascript
	rabbit.listen(function(msg){
		console.log('Message received: ' + msg.content.toString());		
	});
```

You will need to have RabbitMQ up and running for this to work.

Rabbit.listen takes a callback as parameter and that callback will retrieve the message object as parameter.
I've printet the msg object from the tests and it looks like this:

```json
{
    "fields": {
        "consumerTag": "amq.ctag-Y85cFepeqYK75qtz0iDrbg",
        "deliveryTag": 1,
        "redelivered": false,
        "exchange": "TEST",
        "routingKey": ""
    },
    "properties": {
        "headers": {},
        "correlationId": "CORRELATIONIDTEST",
        "timestamp": 1468420458017,
        "appId": "TESTAPPIDALL"
    },
    "content": {
        "type": "Buffer",
        "data": [
            84,
            69,
            83,
            84,
            73,
            78,
            71,
            32,
            49,
            50,
            51
        ]
    }
}
```

To read the content-property, just call .toString as in the example.

## Options

You can of course provide options for setting up amqplib in rabbit-listener.

### protocol

String

### host

String

Default: 'localhost'

The URI of the server that hosts the RabbitMQ.


### virtualHost

Default: ''

Used if RabbitMQ is configured with a virtual host.


### port

Number

Default: 5672

The port that is open for connections to RabbitMQ.

### username

String

Default: 'guest'

Use this if credentials is required.


### password

String

Default: 'guest'

### exchangeType

String

Default: 'topic'

The topic for the exchange.


### exchangeName

String

Default: 'rabbit-chat'

The name of the exchange.

### connectionTimeout

Number or null

Default: null

Set the number of miliseconds before the connections closes automatically. Send null in order to keep connection open.

### callbackOnClose

# Tests

To run tests on this module, make sure that the modules for the tests are installed

```
	npm install rabbit-listener --dev
```

Then run:

```
	npm test
```

NOTICE: The test is not unit test but tests the functionality for submitting to RabbitMQ. So RabbitMQ is required to be installed locally in order to run the tests.
